I went to college for roughly 5-6 years, constantly changing my major and never quite landing on anything. From Criminal Justice to Health Administration, I honestly wasnt sure what to do or what I truly felt like I wanted to do. I worked in the healthcare industry for 11 years. I advanced in health admin and was maybe seeing a future for myself there. However, after awhile, and I mean a long while, I was finally just burnt out working in the medical system. It's a tough job, where you have to have the balance of empathy and apathy, since you can't let terrible situations overly affect you or you might not be able to push through your day to day. So I needed a change.

My partner and I move to Colorado to get a new perspective. I was able to get a contracted job with Google. Working there has changed my perspective immensly. I love working in the Tech industry. The people are social and cheerful, the mood is always uplifting, and the perks alone! It definitely fueled my fire to want to stay in it. I've always thought about coding and have had friends do it with major success. When I saw the flatirons program and the way it is laid out, it was hard to not jump at the opportunity. Especially since we are all stuck in our homes during this time. IT is a great way to finally feel like I am on a career path I will enjoy and be succesful at.
